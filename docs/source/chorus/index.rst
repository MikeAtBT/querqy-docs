Installation
============

Chorus tries to strike a balance between making the getting started experience
quick and easy with also teaching you how all the elements of the Chorus stack
work together.  To that end, we stand up the stack using Docker Compose, but
then have you run all the various commands to integrate the elements together.
We provide a sample product data set for our mock Ecommerce Store as part of this.

The setup documentation is currently in the main Chorus README.txt available at

https://github.com/querqy/chorus#getting-set-up-to-play-with-chorus

Once you have configured Chorus, we have published our first Kata that walks
you through a real life relevancy optimization example:
